/**
 * Contains all the drive code and algorithms for the robot.
 *
 * Here are some standard conventions for all drive code:
 * <ul>
 * <li>forward = positive</li>
 * <li>reverse = negative</li>
 * <li>right = positive</li>
 * <li>left = negative</li>
 * <li>clockwise = negative</li>
 * <li>counterclockwise = positive</li>
 * <li>full speed/power = +/-1.0</li>
 * <li>off/neutral = 0.0</li>
 * <li>distance units = meters</li>
 * <li>angle units = radians</li>
 * <li>x axis = left/right</li>
 * <li>y axis = forward/back</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Some of these things are not totally consistent yet, but I'm working on it.
